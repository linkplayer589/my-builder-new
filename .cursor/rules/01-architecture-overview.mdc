# Project Architecture Philosophy

## Core Principles

1. **FEATURE PORTABILITY**: Features must be self-contained and copyable between projects
2. **CONTEXT SEARCH OPTIMIZATION**: File naming enables finding all related files easily
3. **STRICT BOUNDARIES**: Clear import rules prevent tight coupling
4. **CONVEX PATTERNS**: Database organization follows Convex best practices (queries/mutations)
5. **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**: Layered structure with dependency rules

## Key Rules

- `/app` routes ONLY import from `/features`
- Features are independent (no cross-feature imports)
- All files prefixed with feature/table name for context searching
- Nested features indicate parent-only usage
- Database in `/db` (general) or `/convex` (Convex-specific)
- Generic components in `/components` (no feature dependencies)

## File Naming Convention

**Format**: `[feature-name]-[descriptor].[ext]`

**Examples**:
- `user-table-header.tsx`
- `user-table-hooks.ts`
- `product-catalog-schema.ts`

**Benefit**: Type "user-table" to find ALL related files instantly! 🎯
