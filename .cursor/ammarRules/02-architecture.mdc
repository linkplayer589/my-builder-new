## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Feature-Based Organization

Features are self-contained modules with their own:
- Components
- Types (referenced from `types/`)
- Data/mocks
- Schemas
- Utilities

### 2. Centralized Types

**ALL types go in `types/` folder** - never in feature folders or component files.

### 3. Shared vs Feature-Specific

- **Shared components**: Used across 3+ features → `components/`
- **Feature components**: Used within one feature → `features/[name]/components/`
- **Global utilities**: Used across features → `lib/`
- **Feature utilities**: Used within one feature → `features/[name]/utils/`

### 4. Backend Architecture

- **Convex** handles all backend operations
- Queries, mutations, and actions are in `convex/`
- Server actions are in `convex/_serverActions/`

### 5. State Management

- **Zustand stores** in `stores/` for shared UI state
- **React Context** (rare) for feature-specific contexts
- **Local state** with `useState` for component-specific state

## Import Rules

1. **Features** can import from:
   - `components/` (shared UI)
   - `lib/` (utilities)
   - `types/` (type definitions)
   - `stores/` (Zustand stores)
   - Same feature folder

2. **Features** should NOT import from:
   - Other feature folders
   - `app/` routes

3. **App routes** import from:
   - `features/` (feature components)
   - `components/` (shared UI)
   - `lib/` (utilities)
