# Project Overview - swift17-ui

> **Purpose**: This guide provides AI agents with the complete architecture, conventions, and patterns for developing new features in the swift17-ui project. Follow this guide to ensure consistency, maintainability, and best practices.

## Project Summary

**swift17-ui** is a Next.js 14 application built with a feature-based architecture. The project emphasizes:

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- **Architecture**: Feature-based organization
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- **State**: Zustand for UI state
- **Data Fetching**: Convex (backend-as-a-service)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

## Core Principles

1. **Feature-Based Organization**: All major functionality is organized into self-contained feature modules
2. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with centralized type definitions
3. **Component Reusability**: Shared components in `components/`, feature-specific in `features/[name]/components/`
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between features, utilities, and shared code

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Project Structure**: This project does NOT use a `src/` folder - all directories are at the root level.

⚠️ **Backend**: This project uses **Convex** for backend operations, not Next.js Server Actions. Server-side logic is in `convex/_serverActions/`.

⚠️ **State Management**: Zustand stores are located in `stores/` at the root level, not `src/store/`.

⚠️ **Utilities**: Global utilities are in `lib/` at the root level, not `src/utils/`.
